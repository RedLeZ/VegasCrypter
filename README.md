# VegasCrypter
This code is an example of file encryption and decryption using the Fernet encryption algorithm. Fernet is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses the AES encryption in CBC mode with a 128-bit key for encryption and decryption.

Here is a general description of the code:

The code imports the necessary modules: base64 for encoding and decoding data, Fernet from the cryptography library
